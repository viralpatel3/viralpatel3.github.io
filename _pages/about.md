 A little bit about myself, I am currently doing my co-op as a Machine Learning Engineer where my major role is to develop deep learning-based algorithms to classify myoelectric pulse signals using Tensor Flow and Microsoft Azure Cloud. I have working experience in Machine Learning, Signal Processing and Mechanical Engineering.  Academically, I am a graduate student pursuing masterâ€™s in Data Science(Graduating Dec 2019) from Northeastern University. My career objective is to work as a Machine Learning Engineer in a cross functional team where projects include data preprocessing, visualization, feature transformation, modeling and real time deployment of algorithms in order to support client end goals. I love meditation, music and dogs!!
